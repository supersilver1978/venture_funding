We are tasked with identifying credit risk for a peer to peer lending company. Using machine learning, we will work with imbalanced data to use linear regression machine learning style to correctly predict loans as healthy or high-risk. We will compare the precision and recall with imbalanced and balanced methods.

Technologies
Programming Language: Python and SQL
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Pathlib, Sklearn, Imblearn
Framework: JupyterLab, can also use VS Code
Operating Systems: Microsoft Windows
Installation Guide
1: Install Jupyter Labs and run it from the terminal. Make sure that you make sure you have an up-to-date version of Python Install and run JupyterLab:
2: Copy URL of this repo
3: Clone folder to this repo and open in jupyter labs
4: Ensure that you have the imports correctly identified to download
Usage
Jupyter Lab

Running the code can be done in one of two ways:
You can click the "play" button at the very top of the notebook.
You can click shift + enter on each block of code to run each batch of code as you go through it.

Final Product
We used machine learning linear regression to acurately predict the high-risk loans. The imbalanced data had a recall of 91% so we rebalanced the data and achieved a recall of 99%. You can see the models below.

Balanced Data: rebalanced_report
